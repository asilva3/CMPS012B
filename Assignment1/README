This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Kevin Thai       (kjthai@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Armando Silva    (asilva3@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Kevin Thai spent       _2__ hours working alone.
Armando Silva spent    _1.5__ hours working alone.
We spent               _5__ hours working together.
Kevin Thai spent       _2.5___ hours driving.
Armando Silva  spent  _2.5__ hours driving.
